# influencers-effects-on-social-media-users-with-data-mining-tecniques
With the rapid advancement of technology and the internet, internet users have started to
purchase various products online, such as clothing, electronics, furniture, and cosmetics. In
recent times, social media accounts with a large number of followers, known as social media
influencers, have been able to generate income by sharing links and promoting brands'
advertisements, allowing users to easily access them. Social media users have also started
shopping through these advertisements shared by prominent accounts. This trend has become
quite common today.
In this project, the positive and negative effects of products shared by influential users as
advertisements and collaborations were observed, utilizing the marketing power of social
media. In addition to the feedback received from regular users after purchasing the products,
the extent to which social media influencers influence regular users was also analyzed. User
comments collected from social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube were
preprocessed by being tagged and reaching a common understanding. Sixteen different
preprocessing techniques were tested with machine learning algorithms, and the obtained
results were interpreted.

# PREPOCESSING

# RESULTS

In this project, the focus has been on evaluating the emotional states of tweets-youtube and
training a machine learning model by feeding it with the data, followed by testing its
accuracy.Thus, based on the obtained results, this model can be used in the future.
In conclusion, it has been observed that Naive Bayes Multinomial provides the highest
accuracy (average of 70%) for feature-based training, while KNN (k=3) and Naive Bayes
Bernoulli yield the lowest accuracy.Apologies for the confusion. Thank you for providing the
correct values. It has been observed that KNN (k=3) achieves an average accuracy of 56%,
Naive Bayes Bernoulli achieves an average accuracy of 57%, while Naive Bayes
Multinomial model has slightly higher F-Measure (average of 67%) and ROC values
(average of 84%).
Indeed, based on the F-Measure (average of 67%) and ROC values (average of 84%), it can
be said that the Naive Bayes Multinomial model generally performs better.According to the
data collected during the labeling process, it was observed that there were 897 negative, 2609
positive, and 1667 neutral instances. Based on this, it can be seen that social media
influencers and collaborations targeting the desired audience have a positive impact on
users.These findings highlight the value of social media influencers and collaborations that
have the potential to create a positive impact. Businesses and brands can strengthen their
marketing strategies by collaborating with social media influencers who have the ability to
create positive effects and leave a favorable impression on the target audience.
Additionally, it can be interpreted that popular users on social media create trust among
regular users.
