# influencers-effects-on-social-media-users-with-data-mining-tecniques
With the rapid advancement of technology and the internet, internet users have started to
purchase various products online, such as clothing, electronics, furniture, and cosmetics. In
recent times, social media accounts with a large number of followers, known as social media
influencers, have been able to generate income by sharing links and promoting brands'
advertisements, allowing users to easily access them. Social media users have also started
shopping through these advertisements shared by prominent accounts. This trend has become
quite common today.
In this project, the positive and negative effects of products shared by influential users as
advertisements and collaborations were observed, utilizing the marketing power of social
media. In addition to the feedback received from regular users after purchasing the products,
the extent to which social media influencers influence regular users was also analyzed. User
comments collected from social media platforms such as Twitter and YouTube were
preprocessed by being tagged and reaching a common understanding. Sixteen different
preprocessing techniques were tested with machine learning algorithms, and the obtained
results were interpreted.
